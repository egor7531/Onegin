I don’t mean to please grand people.

With love friends’ notions I’d rate

And give you all that 1 could scribble

As pawn that’s worth of dear mate.

Its worth of fine and charming soul,

Of saint fulfilled generous dreams,

Of lively lucid verse’s glow,

Of lofty thoughts, of simple things.

All right, by hand unfair own

You take my set of florid rhymes

Which are half-funny and half-mournful,

Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful,

Slipshod result of my pastimes,

Of sleepless nights, of inspirations,

Of years young but whithered hard,

Of mind some cold observations,

Of grievous notes of the heart.

CHAPTER ONE

He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel.
